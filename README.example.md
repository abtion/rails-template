If the project is using some special external services (NemID, oAuth, Customer API, etc.) give a short description here.
Example: The app is using NemID to authenticate all its users.

## Development

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) (plugins defined in [.tool-versions](./.tool-versions))

### Configuration

#### Environment

We use [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#customizing-rails) for configuring env vars.

#### Git hooks (optional)

Git hooks defined in [install-hooks](./bin/install-hooks)

```sh
bin/install-hooks
```

### Setup

The recommended way to run the project is to use `docker compose` for databases and `asdf` for installing runtimes.\

For running the project locally:

1. In one terminal window:

    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```

2. In another terminal window:

    ```sh
    asdf install # To install runtimes
    bin/setup # To install dependencies and initialize the database
    bin/rails s # To run the webserver
    ```

3. The project can now be accessed at <http://localhost:3000>

#### Other setups

It is also possible to run everything locally, but it requires locally setting up the services specified in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).\
It will also require changes to the connection string env vars.

#### Available scripts

Checkout the [bin](./bin/) for scripts and binstubs \
[package.json](./package.json) also contains a few frontend specific scripts

Commonly used:

```sh
bundle install # Install ruby gems
npm install # Install frontend dependencies
bin/rspec # Run rails tests
npm run test # Run frontend tests
bin/lint # Run all linters
bin/lint-fix # Run all linters and attempt to fix problems
bin/test-all-strict # Run all tests and linters
bin/shakapacker-dev-server # Watch for frontend changes and compile on the go
```

Spring is also available for development. Since using spring can cause hard-to-debug errors, the binstubs are not springifie, but you can run easily use spring with `bin/spring [command]`, e.g.:

```sh
bin/spring rspec
bin/spring rails s
```

## Good to know

### Notable inclusions and exclusions

Inclusions:

- [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) for authentication
- [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit) for authorization
- [Shakapacker](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) error monitoring
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting javascript files
- [RSpec](https://rspec.info/)
  - [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot)
  - [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) for system specs
- [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) for linting ruby files
- [Sidekiq](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq) for running jobs
- [Spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) (without binstubs)

Exclusions:

- Turbolinks

### Development admin credentials

```txt
user: admin@example.com
password: password
```

### Screenshots in CI

When system spec fails in CI a screenshot will be saved as a Github Actions artifact. If need be you can download the `capybara.zip` file and extract it to get to the screenshots.

### Sidekiq

`Sidekiq` provides useful web-interface (available at [/sidekiq](http://localhost:3000/sidekiq)).

For staging/production envs, username and password are set with - and can be found in - env vars `SIDEKIQ_USERNAME` and `SIDEKIQ_PASSWORD` for the respective envs.

### Deployments

Commits to `main` are automatically deployed to the staging environment (after they've passed [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml)).
Deployments to production happen by promoting the staging environment.
