## Backlog

- As an Abtioneer, you should be working on Asana, as set by the company's standards.
- As an external person, you are free to use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/abtion/rails-template/issues)
  to track bugs and features.
- Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't
  already been submitted.

**Note on security issues:**
Please do not report important security issues directly on GitHub, but feel free to send an email
to <support@abtion.com>.

## Pull requests

All code changes should go through pull requests. Exceptions can be made for
small changes that do not affect the code base. (For example, a typo in the README)

1. Fork the repository.
2. Branch out from `main`
3. Write your code
4. Commit and push your changes
5. Open a pull request

Notes:

- If there's no need for reviews, PRs should be merged when CI has passed.
- If you want reviews on your PR, add the "reviewable" tag.
